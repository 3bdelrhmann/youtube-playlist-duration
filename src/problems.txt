Main Problem : we cannot get a duration time of video because that`s request in youtube maked by js response
and beatifulsoup cannot catch this duration 

my solution : 
	save this html web page in html file
		and get the duration from this file  
             but we have another problem after execution this solution we will get a many html files
              solution : remove file after stop application
  another problem here if ahmed and mohamed send a two requests to site for get duration of play list i don`t know what I don't know what will happen but we will definitely have a problem here
and solution make a unique file name with random library filename3156.html 

second problem : 
	after get a playlist duration
	return x.99655487313
	i am searching for solve this problem and get two numbers after point
	and i found solution but the solution must use math library and thats not an effective solution for this case

my solution : 
	covert this folating number to string and in python thats string is a list
		thats great get list from zero to 5 
			array[:4]
			will print 
			1.31
