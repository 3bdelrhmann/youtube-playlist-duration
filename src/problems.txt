Main Problem : we cannot get a duration time of video because that`s request in youtube maked by js response
and beatifulsoup cannot catch this duration 

my solution : 
	save this html web page in html file
		and get the duration from this file  
             but we have another problem after execution this solution we will get a many html files
              solution : remove file after stop application
  another problem here if ahmed and mohamed send a two requests to site for get duration of play list i don`t know what I don't know what will happen but we will definitely have a problem here
and solution make a unique file name with random library filename3156.html 

second problem : 
	after get a playlist duration
	return x.99655487313
	i am searching for solve this problem and get two numbers after point
	and i found solution but the solution must use math library and thats not an effective solution for this case

my solution : 
	covert this folating number to string and in python thats string is a list
		thats great get list from zero to 5 
			array[:4]
			will print 
			1.31
third problem : 
	in some playlist could not convert string because having an hours and after converting : '1.05.42'
	my application working on video duration in mins if a play list having a video duration hour
	code cannot reading this number 1.05.24
									1 = Hour 
									5 = Minutes
									42 = Sec
	after many trying solutions :
		thats last ::
			add the time in list of main list duration all videos in playlist like that
			[ [1,5,42], ]
			if video duration less than 1 hour like 25.30 25Min 30Sec
			add to main list like that
			[ [1,5,42],[0,25,30] ]
			and sum values
